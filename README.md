<h3>Guidelines / rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Don't use too many colors or gradients</b>
    <p>
      For technical reasons, themes are limited to a palette of only 256 colors. Because of this, please try not to use too
      much shading or too many colors in your theme images.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>No signatures or watermarks</b>
    <p>
      -- That is, should your theme be intended for the Theme Store. Don't worry, there will be a link to your Sudomemo
      Creator's Room on your theme's store page.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Keep it simple</b>
    <p>
      Sure, complexity is impressive. However we would prefer simple, clean designs to keep with the aestetic of the app.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Follow the rules</b>
    <p>
      Of course, make sure that your theme follows the content rules as given in the [Sudomemo Terms of Use](http://www.sudomemo.net/help/?terms).
    </p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>If my theme is on the Theme Shop, will I recieve a commission when others buy it?</h4>
    <p>
      Yes! When someone buys your theme, you will receive 1/5 of the price that they pay in stars. For example, if your theme
      is selling for 10 stars, you will recieve 2 stars commission for each sale! <br>
      You can use these stars to add to Flipnotes that you enjoy, or you can use them to purchase more themes for yourself.

    <h4>Do I need Sudomemo Citizenship to make a theme?</h4>
    <p>
      Sudomemo Citizenship isn't required unless you wish to make a custom theme for your own profile.
    </p>

  <li>
    <h4>Why can't I include copyrighted content or characters from a certain franchise?</h4>
    <p>
      We will not allow themes that contain copyrighted content. <br>
      Any themes containing copyrighted content would be classified as unnoficial merchandise, as a result, we are unable to
      'sell' them.
